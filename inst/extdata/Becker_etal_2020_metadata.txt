Notes on CCE final 2018 average density files for Becker et al. (2020)

Elizabeth A. Becker, Karin A. Forney, David L. Miller, Paul C. Fiedler, Jay Barlow, and Jeff E. Moore. 2020. Habitat-based density estimates for cetaceans in the California Current Ecosystem based on 1991-2018 survey data, U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-SWFSC-638

Notes (for details refer to the Becker et al. 2020 Tech Memo #638)
• The .csv files have columns for latitude, longitude, area (km^2), average 2018 density (1/km^2; species-specific with column names reflective of ID letters below), and CV.  The lat/lons represent the midpoint of the ~ 10km x 10 km pixel resolution used for grid predictions.
• SDMs were built with SWFSC 1991-2018 survey data. To generate multi-year average density surfaces, predictions were made on daily grids encompassing the 1996-2018 surveys (late June – early December), but with year set to 2018 to eliminate the 
abundance trend. Models thus provide "multi-year average density surfaces" at 2018 densities, representative of the summer/fall period.
• Uncertainty (expressed as CVs) accounts for environmental variability during the 2018 survey period.
