Title: Stock apportionment for U.S. West Coast Humpbacks
Author: K. Alexandra Curtis [aut, cre]
Maintainer: K. Alexandra Curtis <alex.curtis@noaa.gov>
Description: A tool that provides stock membership probabilities for humpback 
   whales off the U.S. West Coast, by individual whale (stratum) or as an aggregate, 
   given individual ranges of latitudes and seasons of (potential) occurrence, and 
   assigned weights (e.g., serious injury proration values of individual whales, or 
   relative interaction risk in a stratum). Stock membership probabilities are 
   based on photo-identification data for 2019 to 2024, and are taken from Curtis 
   et al. (2025). Weighted averages across latitude bins are calculated using 
   humpback densities from Becker et al. (2020) and Wright et al. (2021).
