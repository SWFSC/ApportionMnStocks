Title: Assign Stock Membership Probabilities for USWC Humpbacks
Author: K. Alexandra Curtis [aut, cre]
Maintainer: K. Alexandra Curtis <alex.curtis@noaa.gov>
Description: A tool that provides stock assignment probabilities for humpback 
   whales off the U.S. West Coast, individually or as an aggregate, given individual 
   ranges of latitudes and seasons of (potential) occurrence, and serious injury 
   proration values. Stock probabilities are based on photo-identification data 
   and are taken from Curtis et al. (in prep), and weighted averages across latitude 
   bins are calculated using humpback densities from Becker et al. (2020) and 
   Wright et al. (2021).
