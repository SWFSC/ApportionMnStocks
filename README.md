## Description

`ApportionMnStocks` is an R package that allows users to obtain estimates of 
humpback whale stock membership probabilities along the U.S. West Coast, based 
on a latitude (range) and season (summer or year-round), for humpback whale stocks
as designated under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, and using 
photo-identification data from 2019 to 2024.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
